#+TITLE: Welcome to boiCTF

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)][What's a CTF?]]

* URL Endpoints you need to know about

*Note*: Replace <IP> with the actual IP address provided to you.

** Running the binary
For binary CTF, a binary executable is running on port =8081=. To actually run it, use netcat:
#+begin_src bash
nc <IP> 8081
#+end_src

** Getting the binary
Since you're supposed to reverse engineer the binary, the binary along with a hint file is provided to you (with the flag redacted obviously) on the following endpoint:
#+begin_src
<IP>:8080/files
#+end_src

** Posting the flag
Send a post request to =<IP>:8080/= with your BITS ID and the flag in the JSON format to the:
#+begin_src json
{
    "ID": "20XXXXXXXXH",
    "flag": "boiCTF{SAMPLE-FLAG}"
}
#+end_src

** Viewing the leaderboard
The following endpoint returns an array of the top performs and when they submitted the flag in JSON format:
#+begin_src
<IP>:8080/leaderboard
#+end_src
